This version of Meta-AQUA is also used for running MIDCA and a
connection to MCL. See the file INSTALL for instructions that explain
installation. Old documentation exists in Meta-AQUA-doc.txt. The file
index.html makes available an online html version of Cox's (1996)
dissertation on Introspective Multistrategy Learning and Meta-AQUA.
The tar file in this directory is an old archive. NOTE: Documentation
may be inconsistent. We will make some effort to update in the
future. The sample init file (README.clinit.cl) is out of date. POIROT
is no longer a working version.

This version of Meta-AQUA is used for running INTRO, because PRODIGY
uses alisp whereas EXPLAIN is using mlisp. Some of these files have
been updated to incorporate changes from the Meta-AQUA core in POIROT,
but everything is not caught up.
